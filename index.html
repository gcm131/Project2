    <p>Industry of the Ordinary are Adam Brooks and Mathew Wilson.</p>
    <p>Through sculpture, text, photography, video, installation and performance, Industry of the Ordinary (IOTO) engage in a rigorous artistic practice that interrogates the politics of the everyday. Their work is rooted in an ethos of critical engagement, using wit, provocation, and direct public interaction to challenge pejorative notions of the ordinary. By elevating the overlooked and recontextualizing the familiar, they transform the quotidian into a site of inquiry, resistance, and poetic reflection.</p>
